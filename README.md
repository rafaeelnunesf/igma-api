# Igma-api

## About this Project

The idea of the project is create a simple customer registration api, where the main focus is to demonstrate my skills in building apis and in logic and creation of data validation algorithms.

CPF validation was performed based on the rules found [here](https://www.macoratti.net/alg_cpf.htm#:~:text=O).
And the algorithm that was made in this application is present [here](https://github.com/rafaeelnunesf/igma-api/blob/main/src/validation/cpf.validation.ts).
